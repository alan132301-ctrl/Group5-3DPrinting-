            <h2>A Brief History</h2>
            <p>Chuck Hull created the first patented process stereolithography (SLA) in 1984. His concept of layer-by-layer construction of objects using UV-curable resin served as the basis for what is now known as additive manufacturing. Other techniques, such as Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) and Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), quickly followed, expanding the range of materials that could be used from liquids to thermoplastics and powdered polymers and paving the way for additional innovation . From the 1990s to 2000s  industrial adoption to the 2010s consumer boom and present day industrial maturity, 3D printing has been around for over 40 years from a convenient prototyping tool to a pillar of modern manufacturing reflecting broader shifts in digital design, automation and supply chain strategy.
