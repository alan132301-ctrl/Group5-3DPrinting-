            <h2>A Brief History</h2>
            <p>Chuck Hull created the first patented process stereolithography (SLA) in 1984. His concept of
                layer-by-layer construction of objects using UV-curable resin served as the basis for what is now known
                as additive manufacturing. Other techniques, such as Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) and Selective Laser
                Sintering (SLS), quickly followed, expanding the range of materials that could be used from liquids to
                thermoplastics and powdered polymers and paving the way for additional innovation . From the 1990s to
                2000s industrial adoption to the 2010s consumer boom and present day industrial maturity, 3D printing
                has been around for over 40 years from a convenient prototyping tool to a pillar of modern manufacturing
                reflecting broader shifts in digital design, automation and supply chain strategy.

            <h2>How Does 3D Printing Work?</h2>
            <p>3D printing, or additive manufacturing, is a process of creating three-dimensional objects from a digital
                file by adding material layer by layer. The process begins with designing a 3D model using
                computer-aided
                design (CAD) software or 3D scanning technology. The digital model is then sliced into thin layers,
                which are sent to the 3D printer. The printer reads the sliced data and deposits material, such as
                plastic, metal, or resin, layer by layer to build the object from the bottom up. Different 3D printing
                technologies use various methods to deposit and solidify the material, including extrusion, laser
                sintering, and photopolymerization. Once the printing is complete, the object may require
                post-processing,
                such as cleaning, curing, or finishing, to achieve the desired properties and appearance.

            <h2>Summary of Applications and Ethical Challenges</h2>
            <p>
                In aerospace industry, 3D printing technology makes lightweight parts, improves complex geometries,
                which can reduce energy requirement and resources.

                3D printing technology has rapidly changed how products are made in the automotive industry from
                prototyping and testing to fully fledged 3D printed cars from manufacturers such as Local Motors which
                produced the first 3D printed car in 2014

                3D printing technology is an efficient, eco-friendly method for food production, offering good quality
                control at a low cost.

                It also helps streamline processes in architecture, building and construction industry as well as fabric
                and fashion industry, electric and electronic industry, healthcare industry et cetera. However, as the
                healthcare system is getting advantages from the technological evolution and many new devices are
                finding medical applications, ethical considerations and specific legislation to guide this process are
                needed, in order to avoid illicit uses of these technologies and to protect patients’ rights. Rizzo, M.
                L., et al. (2021). "3D printing in healthcare: Ethical and legal challenges." International Journal of
                Environmental Research and Public Health 18(4): 1446.
